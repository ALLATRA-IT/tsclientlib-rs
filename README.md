# TsClientlib
The various libraries in this repository are currently a work in progress so donâ€˜t expect things to work. At the moment, connecting and basic audio is working.

This repository implements the TeamSpeak3 protocol for usage in clients and bots.

If you are searching for a usable client instead of a library, [Qint](https://github.com/ReSpeak/Qint) is a cross-platform TeamSpeak client, which is based on this library.

## Dependencies
- [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org)
- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) (preferred installation method is [rustup](https://rustup.rs)), currently the nightly version is needed

## Getting Started
An example of a simple chat bot can be found [here](https://github.com/ReSpeak/SimpleBot).

## Clone
This repository embeds the [declarations](https://github.com/ReSpeak/tsdeclarations) as submodule. You can clone with
```
git clone https://github.com/ReSpeak/tsclientlib.git --recurse-submodules
```
or download the submodule afterwards with
```
git clone https://github.com/ReSpeak/tsclientlib.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Build and run the example client
The code can be found [here](tsclientlib/examples/simple.rs).
```
cd tsclientlib
cargo run --example simple
```

## Build and run the example audio client
The code can be found [here](tsclientlib/examples/audio.rs).
```
cd tsclientlib
cargo run --features audio --example audio
```


## Projects
You probably want to use tsclientlib, it builds upon all other projects. This list shows what each library does and it may be useful if you want to help developing.

- `tsclientlib`: This is the main product of this repository, a simple to use TeamSpeak library
- `tsclientlib-ffi`: A thin wrapper around tsclientlib, which exports C functions so the library can be used in Qint.
- `tsproto`: The low level library that does the network part. You probably don't want to use that, but a higher level library like tsclientlib.

### Utils
The utils folder contains smaller building blocks for the library.

- `gst-plugin-ts3`: A gstreamer demuxer that takes TeamSpeak audio data and creates a new pad for every client and codec.
- `tsproto-audio`: Creates gstreamer pipelines and generally manages audio stuff to be easy to use.
- `tsproto-commands`: Parse commands into structs (messages) and contains basic types and enums for TeamSpeak.
- `tsproto-structs`: Contains parsed versions of the declarations.
- `tsproto-util`: Contains some utility for code generation from [tsdeclarations](https://github.com/ReSpeak/tsdeclarations).

## How this works
`tsproto` implements the basic TeamSpeak protocol stuff (uh, who would have expected that), which comes down to creating a connection, make sure that udp packets are delivered, encrypt and compress the communication and give access to all these low-level things.

The convenient client library on top is `tsclientlib`. It uses all the versions, messages, structures and errors which are written down in a [machine readable format](https://github.com/ReSpeak/tsdeclarations) and provides a nice and safe api.

## Performance
For benchmarks, a TeamSpeak server has to run at localhost. Run
```
cd tsproto
cargo bench --bench <name>
```
where `<name>` is `connect` or `message`.

On a i7-5280K with 6 cores/12 threads @3.6â€¯GHz, which uses more or less only one thread because we only test a single connection, we get:

- 170â€¯ms for creating one connection, which means 5.9 connections per second. This comes down to solving the RSA puzzle at the beginning of a connection, not much else plays a role. Be sure to run the benchmark with `--features rug` to get an efficient big integer implementation, otherwise it will fall back to a slower implementation.
- 135â€¯Âµs for sending a message, which means 7400 messages per second.

## Miscellaneous
This project is not an official TeamSpeak project. We started to write an own client for fun and because we want some features (and bugfixes) which are not available in the official client.

That said, we do not want to harm the company behind TeamSpeak because we like their product. Otherwise we would just use something else and not write our own client ðŸ˜‰. As TeamSpeak earns its money with selling servers and thus their existence depends on it, we will not publish any server related code and we encourage you to do the same (this may change with the new licensing system, introduced in the 3.1 server).

Thanks TeamSpeak for your software!
