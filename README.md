## Build and run

Build and run the example client

### Miscellaneous

This project is not an official TeamSpeak project. We started to write an own client for fun und because we want some features (and bugfixes) which are not available in the official client.

That said, we do not want to harm the company behind TeamSpeak because we like their product. Otherwise we would just use something else and not write our own client ðŸ˜‰. As TeamSpeak earns its money with selling servers and thus their existence depends on it, we will not publish any server related code and we encourage you to do the same.

Thanks TeamSpeak for your software!
